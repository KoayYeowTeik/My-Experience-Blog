### My-Experience-Blog

## Week 1 
Team Progress: For the first week of the project there was the initial meet up and warming up with my group members, Nathan, Liwei, JunHui and Issac. We just got our problem statement and was assigned a special needs group, the autistic and learning disabled spectrum and started on the planning on how and what to do to solve this problem statement for online banking.

After much discussing it came to an initial agreement of creating some simple user interface design and functions and creating of the wireframe and creating the basic project and initialising the basic roles of each member based on the SCRUM framework that we have learnt recently.

Individual Reflection:
Personally, I felt that my SCRUM master did not fulfil his role in the project as my group took things to the last minute and did not make the necessary preparations which may have bad future consquences. However, since it was everyone's first big project as a group and we have only just started learning the framework, it is understandable that there would be some tension and unhappiness which everyone has to work together and solve. Otherwise as the main developer in the group, I also felt that the solution was not fully met with the problem statement but decided to go along with it for now.

## Week 2
Team Progress: 
For the second week of the project my group was quite silent and split up. The front end side of my group were focused on the design of the wireframe in preparation for the consultation with the OCBC representative while the back end side of my group were focused on research in whether the functions that we plan to implement were possible given the short time frame. For our solution we had the idea to have helper accounts asscoiated with the servere autistic individuals and the usage of Singpass and submission of certain medical documents to register for such an account. Moreover the helper account is able to manage some things within the autistic individual's account like controlling large transactions and monitoring the account actitivty. After everyone had finished and consolidated their work and the wireframe and documentation was mostly done, we met with the representative.

We were told that our idea and solution was not really up to standard and did not really solve the problem statement like I had feared and that we had to think of another better solution to the project.
Individual Reflection: 
Personally, I felt that because my group had chosen a very difficult special needs group associated with our problem statement as I had previously conducted research what problems the autistic may have with online banking and came up short. So I was skeptical about the problem solution and unsure on how my group could actually solve this problem given that there are little source material online and there isn't really a solution to the problem statement with my given age group.

## Week 3
Team Progress: 
For the third week there was an emergency meeting to rediscuss and replan the solution to our problem statement. We had to plan on which items and functions we wanted to keep for our project and which didn't.
However in the end we realised that the solutions and ideas were not sufficient enough and hence we decided to come up with a bigger solution for our problem statement that fits our target focus group. In the end, we settled for a custom AI that will be able to fully customise and control to assist our target group in online banking as well as act as a chatbot to basically automate everything within the application. Although the idea and solution is a bit general it was the best my group was able to come up with given the lack of resources and knowledge and experience with such an target group. After confirming the possibility and feasibility of the idea my group went ahead with the development, even though with the idea is very difficult to implement and my group did not have much experience in this field. One of us also signed up for the OCBC website to create an account to view the main user interface and design by OCBC.

Individual Reflection:
Personally, I felt that my group may not be able to finish the work given we had the idea in the very late stages in the development and we had very little idea of the solution and had to come up with extra material and functions along the way. Even though I came up with the AI idea and still felt like something was missing in our problem statement, but still went ahead as my whole group agreed with the solution I came up with. So I tasked some members in my group to assist me in the preparation of some fake data to train the AI bot.

## Week 4
Team Progress:
The fourth week was the development stage for our group. My group split ourselves into the front end and back end teams which we would then merge our work in the later stage of the project. For the front end team they were tasked to recreate the OCBC main website and user interface and create the design of the custom page for our solution based on our wireframe. For the backend team we were tasked to implement our solutions for our functions like creating facial recognition, the AI implementation with our project and Singpass with no experience. We also had to prepare certain materials to prepare for our presentation. Overall the progression was a quite good.

Individual Reflection:
I was in the backend team, and mostly did more research on my end to see if the new ideas were possible and could be done within the short time frame and split the workload with my other backend developer Nathan. My task was to learn how to fully implement the chatbot into the system and figure out the Singpass while Nathan implemented the facial recognition and the databases. I had to do a lot of research as the idea we are implementing and completly creating the AI from scratch with our custom data will be difficult. In the end I came across some new libraries that were quite interesting and was quite easy to use to implement into the system. I also created the fake data for the database for testing purposes.

## Week 5
Team Progress:
In Week 5, My team and I are having a hackaton for this assignemnt. During this 3 day of hackaton period, I managed to complete the chatbot for back end development. I also manged to help and finish doing up the powerpoint slides and the structure. In the end my backend team as unable to complete some of his functions like the facial recognition so I had to take over whcih serverly delayed the production time as our function were quite complicated. I finished most of the backend function myself but in the end my group did not have time to properly merge the front end with the backend due to the problems as it was initally planned that the functions were to be completed on the first day.

Individual Reflection: 
I mostly did most of the backend work even though I had planned more items to be completed myself like making the AI bot being able to fully perform all its intended functions like auto directory, voice command functions. However due to the workload and very small time window. In the end I was only able to implement the function as my group intended and tried to merge the backend with my front end group which ended up being a disaster and ruined the presentation to the OCBC stakeholders.

## Week 6
Team Progress: 
For this week not much was done in the project as everyone in the group had to prioritise other module assignments.

Individiual Reflection:
I mostly tried to fix the AI  as there were some signs of the API failing and giving weird responses and took an abnormally long time to respond. I also fixed the facial recognition feature and other functions to be fully within the web browser as intended for simplicity.
## Week 7
Team Progress:
This week my group was still working on other modules so not much work was done. The frontend team did a new page to replicate and test some statistics visualisation.

Individual Reflection:
For this week I tried to tackle the issue of the user logging in with facial recognition. However there were some issues with the library I've used to encode the face to be read by the AI system for login whcih failed in the end. However there was some improvement in the AI as there was more time to continouslt train the AI to perform the actions required.

## Week 8
Team Progress:
For this week the group came together to discuss what went wrong with our presentation and project. Many of the group members decided to do some research on the autism spectrum and understand exactly what issues the autistic were having with online banking. However we tried to get in contact with SpecGrow which was recommended by the OCBC representative but we heard no response from them. Moreover we still did not have any response from the OCBC representative about the interview with SpecGrow too. So we had to rely on the research found online. Sadly we found out that the autistic target group did not have much problems with online banking and thus we had to rethink of other ideas for the new solution.

Individual Progress:
For this week I tried to implement custom commands into the AI which allowed the project to detect certain commands issued by the AI to perform specfic functions such as changing directory, form filling and interacting with the webpage itself. In the end I managed to train the AI to detect based on certain keyword and actions whcih produced the functions required, then I wrote a program in the project to detect the functions called which will hopefully perform the required functions called upon.

## Week 9
Team Progress:
This week was Common Test week so not much was done.

Individual Progress:
Not much was done this week either I was only able to get the AI to change directories on voice command but there were still some issues with the directory changing.

## Week 10
Team Progress:
For this week the group came together to fix some issues that were ongoing before the hackathon from week 5. The front end side decided to finalise most of the webpages to focus on the main solution custom pages for the autistic and learning disabled side. The backend team found out that Singpass was not possible to be implemented as it required involovment with the government data. There were still training of the AI to now detect forms and inputs in the webpage to be filled accordingly and we managed to fix the facial recognition login function based on custom data we had.

Individual Progress:
Most of this week for me was training more the AI to ensure that the responses required was 95% accurate to what my group needed.

## Week 11 - Week 12
--Term Break--

## week 13
Team Progress:
For this week my team finally got together to discuss the details on the project. The trello board was redone to our new and final solution and more research was done about our target audience and how our solution can help to impact the target audience in our project. THe frontend team has started to create the final pages and the backend(me) decided to finish integrating all the AI systems into our peoject solution to prevent anything from going wrong which took a while. However, I started to notice that some members were not fulfilling their role in the project.

Individual Progress: For this week I was mainly focused on successfully integrating the AI systems into our project solution. I found two AI systems called FaceAPI and Langchain for the face recognition, emotion detection and chatbot with custom functions to be implemented into the solution. There were many issues with integrating the libraries into the system like faceapi loading of the models files and the code to read it, writing javascript code to connect the code to the libary, and setting up an alternate database to store certain information like images for recognition. I also fully integrated the langchain chatbot features which was better than the hackathon one as it had 10x the processing speed and output than our previous usage. However I started to notice some issues within my team and my team did not want to focus on the AI solution but rather a simple transfer function in our project. The other was not doing anything and giving excuses.

## Week 14
Team Progress:
For this week there were some issues within the team, as I had some problems with one of our members, Issac Khoo for not doing much work since the start of the project and confronted him about it. There was no resolution to that arguement and things went on as per normal. SCRUM master did not try to help but instead sat on one side. The integration and testing of the AI systems were completed so this week backend work was mostly merging it with the frontend and making sure the systems does not crash when running the programs in the background. There was also some refinement in the display of the chatbot chats and a lot of testing. For the frontend 2 new pages were up on our special caretaker account features whcih was done by one person Liwei while the other two were still working on the transfer function which at this point does not feel relevant to the solution. Issac was given one page to style which he only finished at the last week of submission and took very long and his code caused a lot of errors with our AI integration which I had to secretly fix.

Individual Progress:
For this week I mostly focused on making the AI systems with our main soltuion, I focused on making sure that the AI systems were able to work flawlessly with the frontend components and refine any errors within the backend. I also added the custom function of report generating, form filling and the page redirection that automatically does it for any new page created within the solution, which I've spet many sleepless night completly and making sure everything works. It was at that time i realised that most of my group members were not fulfilling their roles and many were not doing sufficient work. I consulted with the lecturer about this and I was informed that 3/5 of my members were not doing their work well which I was the one covering for them.

## Week 15
Team Progress:
For the frontend side it was making sure that everything looked good and the final pages of the solution added were styled properly. The backend subpages had to also be styled. For the backend it was mostly a lot of testing and chatbot training to ensure that the results that were needed had 95% accuracy to make sure during presentation nothing would go wrong as everything in the backend is automated. 

Individual Progress: At this point of the project whcih was the last week only 2 members had really been doing work after the hackathon. Me and Liwei. I completly did the backend with the AI systems research and integration into the solution and Liwei did 80% of the remaining pages and frontend functions and styled my AI soltuions. The team was not properly managaed as there was no sense of direction as the Product Owner was not updating the trello board. The SCRUM master did not assist in the resolution of group altercations as I confronted one for not doing work. And the Product Owner and SCRUM master only focused on the transfer function in our online banking solution, which wasn't the main focus as we were focusing 95% on the AI systems. The last person didn't even do anything other than style three pages, not show up for meetings and caused a lot of problems in the project code. In the end my team had something to submit but it was mostly the work of 2 people out of the 5.
